# krt.mn

My own url shortener based on [yourls - Your Own URL Shortener](http://yourls.org/) ([Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/yourls/))

It has a public front page under http://krt.mn with the latest shortened url. The backend is a completely restyled interface based on the YOURLS default styles (which are quite ugly). Here's what it looks like in the admin area:

## License & Usage

As the original YOURLS you're free to do whatever you want with this as long as you're not reusing the [iconsweets font](http://iconsweets.com/). And using this without further modifications as your own url shortener isn't a good idea either.
